This project is intended to organize the ideas, processes, and supporting templates and tools required to succeed as a new CISO. While it will have humble beginnings, we hope it will grow and evolve with engagement from the community over time.  Please use the Wiki as a general guide and knowledgebase and reference the folders for supporting documents and templates.
